## It's a summary of the paper with my opinions

## Published
- 

## Work Goal
Investing whether existing eye tracking solutions are applicable without prior calibration procedures.

## Research Questions
- RQ1: How better a Pro eye tracking took compared to webcam based tracker?
- RQ2: What is the achievable eye gaze distance range of a webcam-based sponteneous eye gaze tracking solution(non calibrate) than a pro tracker (Calibrate)
- RQ3: How aggresive is the face-fitting algorithm used in WebGazer eye tracking library and how much does it affect the gaze prediction on screen viewport

## Sponteneous Eye Gaze Tracking
**Important Note**
A study in sdX MOOC environment outlined privacy and perceved benifits from using a system as the two main reasons when deciding over allowing a website  to access webcam. So the requirement is No webcam video-feed must leave the browser environment and transmitted to any servers. Gaze data is to be processed on local machine, and only established eye coordinates are allowed to be transmitted.

## Eye gaze information information can be used to improve
- layout of information delivary
- drive conclutions on user attentiveness and areas of interest
- gain additional data for recommendations

## Equipments
- Dell inspiration  5759 laptop
- 17 inch screen (1920*1080)
- google chrome, windows 10
- Tobii X2-30 eye tracker was used. attached to the lower screen bazel 

## Tested on
- 20 participant (14 male, 6 female)
- 9 normal, 9 glass, 2 contact lense
- 16 normal light, 4 low light with infered light pointing in their eyes
## Result 
- Webgazer precision compared to pro is 100px
