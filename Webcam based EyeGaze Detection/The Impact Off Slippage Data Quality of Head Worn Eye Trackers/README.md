1. Tobbi->SMI->GRIP->Pupil-labs
2. Grip->Pupil-labs->Tobbi->SMI
3. SMI-> Grip->Pupil Labs->tobbi
## the complete process 
- Validation 
- No movement
- Vowels
- Facial Expression 
- Horizontal Eye tracker movement
- Vertical Eye tracker movement
- Depth Eye tracker movement
- Validation
## Loss Calculation
Data Loss = 100 * ((Nexpected_samples - Nvalid_samples)/Nexpected_samples)
