## Goals
- Graphical user interface combines gaze based input with gesture based user commands
- It's alternative of touchscreen if the monitor isn't touchscreen (touch command == gesture based command)

## Work Flow (What I understand)
- Take 3 data input for calibration 
- Determine estimated gaze point
- Determine Direction.Speed of estimated gaze point 
- Store Information related to Intended Gaze point
- Adjust error
- Improve Calibration with previous experience
